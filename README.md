## Scientific calculator

### Task

A scientific calculator extends the functionality of a standard calculator. In general, a scientific calculator would support various complex functions and provide high-levels of machine precision for floating-point computation. Check out the HiPER Scientific Calculator or Desmos Graphing Calculator in the Google Play store to see how the advanced scientific calculator should look like.

**Default features**
* Scientific keyboard support (e.g. trigonometric functions, log/expression functions, etc)
* Parsing & execution equation with brackets e.g. (, {, [, ], }, )
* Equation editing (i.e. after computing a certain equation, one can modify the computed equation and recompute the result)
* Defining function (a defined function can be reused multiple times. i.e. define f(x,y) = 2x+3y then call f(1,2), f(2,3), â€¦)
* Saving and loading equations/functions (i.e. one can reload the saved equation after restarting the app)

**Advanced feature**
* Function plots: a calculator plots the functions defined by a user.


## Marking Rubric

The below marking rubric is taken from [here](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2100/assessments/02-project/). 


| Mark | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| SW design / Code quality | Cannot find proper SW design decision and design summary. Code is somewhat inconsistent. Commented without standard Javadocs style. | An appropriate design approach was taken. You have given a good summary of the design on your project wiki. Code is consistently formatted and appropriately commented. | The design is good in terms of OO aspects, cohesion, and coupling. At least one design pattern is used properly. Variable, function, class names are well-chosen. Exception and errors cases are checked. | Project is well modularized. Easy to extend. Code is robust and repetition is minimized. Good use of JavaDocs |
| Testing | Cannot find a JUnit testing suite. Minimal test cases can be found. | A clear testing summary is provided in the wiki and some JUnit testing is done on some aspects of the project. | Repeatable unit testing is done on the majority of the project. Some integration/system testing on your system is done. | Include some automated integration/system testing. JUnit coverage test achieves at least 80% of code. |
| Team work	| Cannot find (at least 3) minuted meetings. One man team (evident from git history). | Tasks have been well divided with each member completing a significant part of the project. | Communication has worked well within the group and you have been able to adapt to a situation that has arisen. | You have been able to produce something better by working as a team than any one individual could have produced. |
| App User Interface | Interface is somewhat hard to understand and unintuitive. | The app works, uses a standard interface, and is simple to use. | The app user interface is well designed and includes a manual. | Your app is able to work under different screen sizes. |
| Wiki documentation | Documentation is incomplete. | Documentation is incomplete. | The documentation is clear, concise, complete, and well-formatted. | The documents include comments of analysis and reflection that show you have mastered these aspects of the project. |
